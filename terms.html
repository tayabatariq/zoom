              1. All block booking payments are non-refundable. In exceptional
              circumstances and at the instructor’s discretion any refunds that
              are to be made should be directly with the instructor, not Zoom
              Drive Head Office. Zoom Drive cannot be held responsible for any
              payments made to the driving instructor.<br /><br />
              2. If you have chosen to undertake driving tuition, this agreement
              is between you and your Zoom Drive franchise instructor. No
              contractual liability shall arise or subsist between you and Zoom
              Drive.<br /><br />
              3. The following applies to all Block Bookings and promotional
              offers: There cannot be a break between the lessons of more than 3
              weeks; otherwise, the remaining lessons will be forfeited. Abuse
              of these offers will result in the remaining lessons being revoked
              without a possibility of a refund. (This does not affect your
              statutory rights.)<br /><br />
              4. The driving school allows 15 minutes waiting time for the
              instructor, due to unforeseen delays such as traffic, etc.<br /><br />
              5. In the event of a mechanical breakdown of the vehicle in which
              you have been learning to drive, or for any other reason, the
              instructor reserves the right to rearrange a driving lesson to a
              time convenient to both you and the instructor.<br /><br />
              6. The driving instructor cannot be held responsible for driving
              tests postponed or cancelled by the Driving Standards Agency.<br /><br />
              7. Where payments are made directly to the instructor, Zoom Drive
              does not accept responsibility whatsoever for any acts, default or
              failure on the part of the instructor not to carry out his or her
              obligations.<br /><br />
              8. Cancellations should be made directly with the instructor 48
              hours prior to the lesson appointment; otherwise, the lesson is
              chargeable.<br /><br />
              9. We reserve the right to refuse a driving lesson or terminate a
              driving lesson should the driver be under the influence of alcohol
              or any other substances that would contravene road safety.
              <br /><br />
              10. A test can only be booked with the full consent of the driving
              instructor. While every effort will be made by your instructor,
              should the pupil fail to reach a satisfactory standard of driving,
              or is likely to be a danger to themselves, third parties or
              property, We reserve the right to withdraw our cars for tests
              without notice should the instructor consider that you are not at
              test standard. <br /><br />
              11. If you buy a block booking and you don’t have regular lessons
              maximum 2 hours every week then the package is not valid.<br /><br />
              12. On the First lesson you must bring your provisional driving
              licence (the green card) valid for the UK and Northern Ireland
              must be provided. If you hold an older provisional licence, photo
              ID is required. [E.g. Passport, Student Photo etc.]<br /><br />

              13. Pupils must be able to read a vehicle number plate from 67ft
              (20.5m) If pupil needs glasses or contact lens for corrective
              vision, these must be worn whenever driving.<br /><br />
              14. The pupil must satisfy themselves with regards to the
              residency requirements laid down by the DVSA. If you are in any
              doubt, contact the DVSA before booking your course. <br /><br />

              15. All pupils are expected to maintain good behaviour and
              satisfactory manners. Good behaviour and manners should be always
              exhibited during your course. Any abusive behaviour, physical
              damage or unseemly conduct to your instructor or any
              representative of Zoom Drive will not be tolerated and may lead to
              immediate cancellation of your course without refund. In addition,
              the responsible pupil must pay for any damage or shortfalls.
              <br /><br />
              16. If Zoom Drive instructors, examiners or general public receive
              any kind of threat or abusive behaviour from the pupil in any way
              will not be tolerated and may lead to reporting you to the police
              and may lead to prosecuting.<br /><br />

              17. The tuition vehicle must be treated with care and respect. Any
              wilful or malicious damage must be paid for by the pupil
              responsible.<br /><br />

              18. Any waiting time will be treated as constituting driving time.
              E.g. if waiting at a theory test centre or travel to and from the
              practical test centre.<br /><br />

              19. No guarantee can be made by Zoom Drive as to the availability
              of DVSA tests on the dates requested. <br /><br />

              20. Zoom Drive cannot, will not, be held responsible for any
              expenses incurred in the event of the DVSA cancelling a test. In
              such cases, all complaints are solely with the DVSA and must be
              made to them alone. <br /><br />
              21. Zoom Drive will endeavour to retain the same instructor
              throughout your course. However, Zoom Drive reserve the right to
              change this policy in the event of ill health, holidays,
              breakdowns or any other unforeseen circumstances.<br /><br />

              22. In the interests of safety, pupils must follow the
              instructor’s directions and instructions at all times. If the
              pupil will not, or cannot, act to instructions in the interest of
              safety the course will become forfeit.<br /><br />

              23. In the event of any lesson being cancelled due to adverse
              weather conditions, one of the 2 following conditions will apply
              (not both) <br /><br />

              – 50% of the daily rate will be refunded.<br /><br />

              – If the customer chooses to re-book this lost time, a 50%
              discount will be applied. If the customer does not re-book the
              lost time no refund will be made.<br /><br />
              24. Once a pupil starts a lesson or replies they agree with the
              terms and conditions they are bound by them.<br /><br />
              25. Prices can vary and Zoom Drive has the right to change
              them.<br /><br />

              Not happy? Zoom Drive would like you to be delighted with your
              driving lessons. If you are not satisfied, then any complaint
